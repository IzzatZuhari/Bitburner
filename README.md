Downloading the whole repository

If you manually nano git-pull.js from the terminal and copy the contents of that script, you should be able to run it once and download the rest of the files I use. Early-game, many will be useless because they are only enabled by late-game features, but they shouldn't give you too many problems just being ther



1 - Nano [create-logger.js](https://github.com/IzzatZuhari/Bitburner/blob/main/create-logger.js) and [Utils](https://github.com/IzzatZuhari/Bitburner/blob/main/utils.js)

2 - Nano [sync-script](https://github.com/IzzatZuhari/Bitburner/blob/main/sync-script.js)

3 - run sync-script.js

4 - nano breach.js and utilz.js

5 - done
